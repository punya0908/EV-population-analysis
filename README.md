⚡ EV Population Analysis

An exploratory data science project that dives deep into electric vehicle (EV) adoption using the Electric Vehicle Population dataset. This project visualizes trends, highlights insights, and helps interpret patterns across manufacturers, vehicle types, and model years.

📌 Overview

This project analyzes the Electric Vehicle (EV) Population dataset to identify adoption patterns, leading manufacturers, popular models, and the distribution of EV types over time. With interactive visualizations and well-structured EDA, it presents a comprehensive view of the EV landscape.

🎯 Objectives

The project is structured around key analysis goals:

- **Manufacturer & Make Distribution** → Breakdown of EVs by manufacturer and model.
- **Top Model Counts** → Identification of the most popular EV models.
- **Model Year Trends** → Analyzing EV adoption over model years.
- **Electric Range Analysis** → Distribution and statistics around EV range.
- **Vehicle Type Breakdown** → Comparison of battery vs. plug-in hybrid EVs.
- **Geographic Spread (Optional)** → EV registration distribution across locations.
